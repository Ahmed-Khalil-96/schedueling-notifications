# Scheduled Notifications Service

The **Scheduled Notifications Service** automates the process of sending notifications based on user-defined schedules. Built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, this service provides flexible scheduling options for daily, weekly, monthly, and custom intervals. It utilizes **Moment.js** for precise scheduling and **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for delivering notifications.

## üöÄ Features

- **One-Time and Recurring Notifications**: Supports one-time notifications or recurring schedules (daily, weekly, monthly, or custom intervals).
- **Flexible Time Zone Support**: Users can specify time zones, allowing notifications to be scheduled and sent accurately across different regions.
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Notifications can be set to repeat based on user preferences, with custom intervals available.
- **End Date Tracking**: Notifications will automatically stop sending after the specified end date.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures that any failed notifications are logged and can be retried if necessary.
- **Job Queuing**: Uses **BullMQ** to manage and process notification jobs efficiently, ensuring reliability in sending notifications.
- **Data Persistence**: Utilizes **Redis** to store job and notification statuses, providing a fast, in-memory data structure store.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Features a user-friendly interface for managing notifications, viewing logs, and tracking the status of sent notifications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing notification schedules and status
- **Job Queue**: BullMQ for processing notification jobs
- **Caching**: Redis for managing job statuses and performance
- **Scheduling**: Node-Cron and Moment.js to handle time-based scheduling and conversions
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for sending push notifications to clients

## üìã API Endpoints

### 1. **Create Notification**
   - **Endpoint**: `/api/notifications`
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Body Parameters**:
     - `title`: Title of the notification
     - `body`: Content of the notification
     - `fcmToken`: Device token for Firebase Cloud Messaging
     - `scheduledTime`: Date and time to send the notification
     - `repeatType`: Recurrence type (`none`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `custom`)
     - `interval`: (Optional) Number of days for custom recurrence
     - `daysOfWeek`: (Optional) Days of the week for weekly recurrence
     - `endDate`: (Optional) Date after which the notification should stop
     - `timeZone`: User‚Äôs time zone for accurate scheduling

### 2. **Update Notification**
   - **Endpoint**: `/api/notifications/:id`
   - **Method**: PUT
   - **Body Parameters**: Same as **Create Notification**

### 3. **Delete Notification**
   - **Endpoint**: `/api/notifications/:id`
   - **Method**: DELETE

### 4. **Get All Notifications**
   - **Endpoint**: `/api/notifications`
   - **Method**: GET
   - **Description**: Retrieves all notifications with their status and scheduling details.

## üîÑ Notification Scheduling Logic

The Cron job runs every second to check for notifications that are due to be sent:

1. **Fetch Notifications**: Retrieves all pending notifications from the database.
2. **Check Schedule**: For each notification, it checks if the scheduled time matches the current UTC time.
3. **Send Notification**: If due, it sends the notification using FCM.
4. **Repeat Logic**: If the notification has a repeat type, it calculates the next scheduled time using the `nextRepeat` function and updates the schedule in the database.
5. **End Date**: If an end date is provided and reached, the notification status is marked as "sent," stopping further recurrence.

### `nextRepeat` Function

The `nextRepeat` function calculates the next occurrence based on the repeat type:
- **Daily**: Adds 1 day
- **Weekly**: Adds 1 week
- **Monthly**: Adds 1 month
- **Custom**: Adds a specified interval in days
